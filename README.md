Test Driven Development activity from the Software Engineering course taught by [Professor Igor Cavalcanti](https://github.com/cavalcantigor/), part of the Systems Analysis & Development program at [UNDB - Centro Universitário Dom Bosco](https://www.undb.edu.br/?utm_source=direto). The assignment represents 20% of the second grade and is to be carried out in groups of three.

## The activity consists of two steps:
### #1 - Implement algorithms to solve the problems below:
>* Given an array of size N, return the sum of all elements;
>* Given a square matrix of size N, sum the values from each diagonal and return the absolute value of their substraction;
>* Check if a given string of size N is or isn't a palindrome.
### #2 - Create as many tests as the group deems necessary to assert the correctness and precision of the solutions developed. 

## Technologies used:

In order to write the algorithms, we used ***JavaScript***; to test them, we used ***Jest***.
