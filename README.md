Test Driven Development activity from the Software Engineering course taught by [Professor Igor Cavalcanti](https://github.com/cavalcantigor/), part of the Systems Analysis & Development program at [UNDB - Centro Universitário Dom Bosco](https://www.undb.edu.br/?utm_source=direto). The assignment represents 20% of the second grade and is to be carried out in groups of three.

## The activity consists of two steps:
### #1 - Implement algorithms to solve the problems below:
>* Given an array of size ***n***, return the sum of all elements, for `0 < n <= 1000`;
>* Given a square matrix of size ***n***, sum the values from each diagonal and return the absolute value of their substraction, for `2 <= n <= 1000` and each element being an integer ***m*** `-100 < m[i][j] <= 100`;
>* Given string of size ***n***, check if it is or isn't a palindrome, for `0 < n <= 1000`;
### #2 - Create as many tests as the group deems necessary to assert the correctness and precision of the solutions developed. 

## Technologies used:

In order to write the algorithms, we used ***JavaScript***; to test them, we used ***Jest***.
